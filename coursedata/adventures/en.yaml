                ## Make a story
                In Level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                As the first line, use this code:

                `ask who is the protagonist of your story`

                After that first line, start with `print` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                You use `echo` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.

                ## Example Hedy code
                ``
                ask The main character of this story is ...
                print The main character is now going to walk in the forest
                echo He's a bit scared who ...
                print He hears crazy noises everywhere
                print He's afraid this is a haunted forest
                ``

                ## What's next?
                It is a pity that you can now only make sentences in which the main character is at the end of the sentence right? After practicing with this story, continue to level 2 and then to level 3, where you can make more and more complicated programs.

              start_code: "print Your story starts here"
          2:
              story_text: |
                ## Story in Level 2
                In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.

                ## Example Hedy Code

                ```
                name is ask What is the name of the main character?
                print name is now going to run in the woods
                print name is a bit scared
                print He hears crazy noises everywhere
                print name is afraid this is a haunted forest
                ```

                ## Randomness
                You can also add something random to your story. Any monster, animal or other obstacle.

                It goes like this:
                ``
                animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                print He now hears the sound of an animal at random
                ``

                ## What's next?
                Did you happen to try to make a sentence that contained the word name?
                E.g. `print my name is name`. Give it a try if you haven't already.

                That is not working properly! Then you get: my Henk is Henk. You can solve that in Level 3.
              start_code: "print Your story"
          3:
              story_text: |
                ## Story in Level 3
                You may have noticed that there is still a mistake in Level 2.

                Did you happen to try to make a sentence that contained the word name? E.g. `print my name is name`.

                That didn't work well! Then you get: my Henk is Henk. You can solve that in Level 3.

                You must use quotation marks for everything that you are going to print.

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                name is Hans
                print 'The name of the main character is' name
                print name 'is now going to walk in the woods'
                print name 'is a bit scared'
                animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                print 'He hears the sound of an' animals at random
                print name 'is afraid this is a haunted forest'
                ```
              start_code: "print Your sotry will be printed here!"

                ## Story in Level 4
                What you can do in level 4 is make your story even more fun. In level 4 you can program different endings.

                Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                - The princess is walking through the forest
                - She runs into a monster

                - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in level 3. You can combine that with an `if`, and then you have already made a whole program!

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                name is ask Who is walking in the forest?
                print name 'walks through the forest'
                print name 'encounter a monster'
                end is ask Would you like a good or a bad ending?
                if the end is good print name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away' else print 'The monster eats' name
                ```
              start_code: "print Hier komt straks jouw verhaal!"
          5:

                ## Story in Level 5
                In story, someone says words several times. For example when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                You can put such repetition in your story in Level 5 with 'repeat'.

                ## Example Hedy code
                ```
                print 'The prince kept calling for help'
                repeat 5 times print 'Help!'
                print 'Why isn't anyone helping me?'
                ```

              start_code: "repeat 5 times print 'Help!'"
    songs:
      name: "Sing a song!"
      image: "songs.png"
      description: "Print a song"
      levels:
        5:
          story_text: |
            ## Songs in Level 5
            Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

            Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
            Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
            Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
            Baby Shark

            You can make this song much shorter with a `repeat`! Can you finish the code?

            ## Example Hedy code
            ``
            repeat ... ... print 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
            print 'Baby Shark'
            ``

            After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.
          start_code: "print 'Baby Shark'"
        6:
          story_text: |
            ## Songs in Level 6
            Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based counting.
            For example in the well-known song 'bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.

            ## Example Hedy code
            ```
            verse is 99
            print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
            print verse ' bottles of beer'
            print 'Take one down, pass it around'
            verse is verse - 1
            print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
            ```

            You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.

            # Looking ahead
            In Level 5 we learned to repeat 1 line with `repeat`, like this:

            * repeat 3 times print 'Baby Shark Tutududududu'

            But as you will see in this lesson, sometimes you want to repeat several lines together. This can be done with cutting and pasting, but that is a lot of work. In level 7 you will learn how to do that more easily.
