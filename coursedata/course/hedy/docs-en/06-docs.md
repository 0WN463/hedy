title: Instructions
level: 6

Level 6 has a lot of new commands that allow you to do maths in your programs.

The addition sign is an easy one, it’s just like maths: for example, `5 + 5`.

You can subtract by using the `-` as a minus sign: `5 - 5`.

The sign for multiplication is a slightly different, because there is no special multiplication sign on your keyboard (except maybe for the letter x). Check it out, it’s really not there! That’s why we use the star (or asterisk) that’s above the 8 on your keyboard: `5 * 5` means 5 times 5.

You can divide by using the slash, like so: `20 / 5`.

# Sing a song with numbers in it

Childrens’ songs often contain a lot of repetition and sometimes numbers as well. An example is the American children’s song called 99 bottles of beer on the wall.

1 `verse is 99`

2 `print verse  'bottles of beer on the wall'`

3 `print verse 'bottles of beer'`

4 `print 'You take one down, pass it around'`

5 `verse is verse - 1`
6 `repeat 2 times print verse 'bottles of beer on the wall'`

7 `print verse 'bottles of beer'`

8 `print 'You take one down, pass it around'`

You can copy lines 6-8 and paste them under your program to keep the song going! Can you reach 0?

# That’s a lot of copy and paste

In Level 5 you’ve learned to repeat one line, for example:

* `repeat 3 times print 'Baby Shark Tutududududu'`

But as you can see in the 99 bottles of beer song, sometimes you want to repeat a couple of lines together instead of one single line. You can alway use copy and paste, but that’s a lot of work. In level 7 you’ll learn an easier way to repeat multiple lines!
