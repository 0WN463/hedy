The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} {right}` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} {left}` turns counter clockwise.\nIf you want to go backwards, you use the `{forward}` command but with a negative number. So for example `{forward} -100`\n\nThis is the start of a little staircase. Can you make it have 5 steps?\n"
