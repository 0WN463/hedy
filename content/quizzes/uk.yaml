            -   option: There shouldn't be quotation marks in line 2
                feedback: No, there should be!
            -   feedback: Correct!
                option: The variable is called correct answer, but a variable's name can only be 1 word. So it should be correct_answer
            -   option: The `{if}` and `{else}` commands should be in the same line.
                feedback: No, that's not true.
            -   option: The variable in line 2 can't be called answer, because it is too similar to the variable correct answer.
                feedback: Variable names can be similar, but they can't be 2 words...
            correct_answer: B

            -   option: It could have been `price = 3` just as well.
                feedback: No, that's not true. Hedy needs to add 3 dollars to the total.
            -   option: Because Hedy doesn't understand `price = 3`.
                feedback: Hedy would understand, but it wouldn't be right.
            -   option: Because Hedy would otherwise forget about the previous order. The price would be 3 dollars in total.
                feedback: That's right!
            -   option: Because the price is 0 dollars to begin with.
                feedback: That's true, but not the reason
            correct_answer: C
            hint: The price shouldn't be 3, but 3 dollars more than it already was

                feedback: You are!.
            -   option: You don't have to use indentation twice.
