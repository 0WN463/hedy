                feedback: No, there should be!
            -   feedback: Correct!
                option: The variable is called correct answer, but a variable's name can only be 1 word. So it should be correct_answer

                feedback: No, that's not true.

            -   option: Because Hedy doesn't understand `price = 3`.
                feedback: Hedy would understand, but it wouldn't be right.
            -   option: Because Hedy would otherwise forget about the previous order. The price would be 3 dollars in total.
                feedback: That's right!
            -   option: Because the price is 0 dollars to begin with.
                feedback: That's true, but not the reason
            correct_answer: C
